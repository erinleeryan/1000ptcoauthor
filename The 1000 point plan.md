1000 point plan for astronomy paper coauthorship
=======

Warning: this plan was written by an observational astronomer and thus has the biases and leanings of observational projects the author is used to. This also will likely not be a good plan for large surveys where coauthorship complex, but it may be a good starting point


----------
***1000 point research plan for paper coauthorship: > 125 points = coauthor, < 125 points = acknowledgement ***
*points are tallied for each person individually *


 - **Component 1: The proposal (200 points)**
 Point breakdown for the proposal is 50% (100 points) text, 50% (100 points) figures and tables

	Text points: to be split by section/subsection. For example: 2 sections (1 Science, 1 Technical) with 3 subsections each = 6 subsections. Each subsection worth 100/6 = 16.67 points. Points only awarded if > 60% of proposal text in section contributed by individual.

	Figures and tables points: Figures and tables are key for grabbing skim readers and for telling a story, hence the equal point value relative to the text. Points awarded are proportional to the number of figrues/tables and go to the figure/table creator.

	For individuals who neither author significant portions nor create tables/figures: 
	Generic comments on proposal prior to submission : 10 points (total)
	Specific edits to figure captions : 10 points per figure (requires >= 1 sentence for full 10 point reward. No reward < 3 words, 5 points for minor sentence reword)

	*In cases of ground based projects with NASA/NSF funding:*

	120 points to be assigned to work from funding proposal (because money makes the project run), the other 80 points are split amongst all the observing proposal. Fractional split of 50% of points to text, 50% to figures & tables remains for the funding proposals, generic comments and edits to figure captions reduce to 6 points.

 - **Component 2: Observing (200 points)**
	2 key components to observing are identifying the targets for observation (determining what targets are up & for how long, what targets in the program still need data, etc) and the actual observing itself. Points shall be split 50/50 between the prep and the observing and all points shall be distributed by observing run. Thus: 5 observing runs for a project = 40 points per run with 20 points going to prep person and 20 points to each observer. Observers who do not stick out the full observing run shall only be awarded a fraction of observing points based on nights they were present at the telescope.  Points are *only* awarded to present observers, none shall be awarded to faculty advisors who sent their students or postdocs.

	*For space telescopes/queue based observing:* Observing points go to the individuals who check the scheduling and pointing from the observatory and verify the observatory's proposed strategy fits the science requirements. Prep points go to the person who compiled the target sample in the observing proposal.

 - **Component 3: Reduction/Calibration/Catalogs (200 points)**
	 Wrangling data into something useable is a major undertaking. Points for reduction/calibration/catalogs shall also be split on a per run basis *EXCEPT* when an individual creates/writes a propelling that does a major component of the the reduction/calibration/catalog production that other individuals apply to the observed deadline. In the case of a pipeline, the pipeline author is immediately awarded 100 points, and the remaining 100 points for data processing are split by observing runs worth of data. Points are only awarded for properly calibrated and reduced data and deliver of resultant catalogs to PI. Examples that will not be rewarded points include: extracted spectra that is wavelength calibrated by not flux calibrated, imaging data that has been bias subtracted & flat fielded with photometry catalogs produced but has not been properly defringed in i and z band with a blue sensitive CCD.

 - **Component 4: Analysis (200 points)**
	Points are split by analysis element if analysis is complex. 
	
	*Examples of complex analysis include:* fitting asteroid taxonomic types to spectra or spectrophotometry, fitting of spectral energy distributions, statistical analysis comparing 2 different data sets (such as the data set produced for current publication vs literature), comparison of distribution functions, fitting of distribution functions
	
	*Analysis that does not count as rigorous includes:* making color-color plots from only the data contained in observing project catalogs

 - **Component 5: Paper writing (200 points)**
	Points for the paper are split between writing the first full draft and presubmission and post referee's report edits

	*First full draft (150 points):*  The 150 points are split such that 75 points go to text, 75 points to tables and figures. Similar to proposals, the text points are split by subsection and full points are only awarded to if 60% of text originates from one individual. Half points are awarded per subsection for 30-59% original text. For tables and figures, full points are awarded to those who make the figure/table.

	*Edits (50 points):* Editting points are split to 25 points for presubmission edits and 25 points to edits/fixes done in response to the referee's report.



*Coauthors who lack the requisite points for coauthorship prior to the paper writing stage might not be considered as authors as their contribution in earlier stages deemed uncritical to the work. If co-author has < 80 points prior to the paper writing stage this represents < 10% contribution to the work and they must justify their authorship to the PI.*
